<p>3rd Witham (St Nicholas) Scout group is open to boys and girls aged between 6 and 10 regardless of faith.</p>
<p>We have a historical affiliation to St Nicolas Church, and while we still link with them this does not exclude those of non Christian faith or those without a religion from joining the scout group.</p>
<p>We are located at our own hall we share with GirlguidingUK adjacent to Spring Lodge Community Centre on Powers Hall Road.</p>
<p>We operate 2 age groups and have strong links to the local Witham Explorer Scout Unit.</p>
<p>Beavers 6 to 8 year olds; Tuesdays 1800 to 1930hrs</p>
<p>Cubs 8 to 10 1/2 years old; Monday 1830 to 2000hrs</p>
<p>Scouts 10 1/2 to 14 year olds; Currently closed.</p>
<p>At 14 young people have the options to move on to Explorers and become young leaders.</p>
<p>We follow the Scout Association guidelines for a balanced program, meaning one week your young person could be pitching a tent, and the next week learning about the history of our town. Your young person may experience any of the
following, climbing, community volunteering, swimming gala, kayaking, pioneering, axe saw and knife training, fire station visit, zip line, sweet making, remembrance parade, blind sandwich making, orienteering, home help skills, shelter
building, survival skills, dementia awareness, backwards cooking, caving, circus skills, craft, team sports, games, surfing, DIY skills, fundraising, hiking, map reading and navigation, communication skills, international friendship,
sleep overs, and day trips.</p>
<p>All young people get the opportunity to work towards the Scout Associations awards scheme during section meetings, and this can also be done at home by the young person with or without assistance from the parents.</p>
<p>All leaders and helpers are volunteers, giving their time freely to nurture, provide experiences, and skills for life to the young people of Witham. Many of these volunteers have been involved with Scouts since they were children and
now want to pass on their knowledge. This doesn't mean we don't welcome new volunteers into the group and anyone is welcome to join us as a leader or helper regardless of Scout experience. Our number one priority is child protection and
for that reason all volunteers under go Disclosure and Baring scheme checks inline with Scout association policy.</p>
<p>A membership subscription is payable, your child's section leader will give you details.
The group only survives through charitable donations, grants, and fundraising, help from parents and the young people at fundraising events is crucial to the survival of the group. The Executive volunteer committee assist the group by
ensuring funds are available for equipment, building maintenance, and that the grounds and building are clean and safe for the young people. Help from more parents is always needed. Please contact <a

your professional or general support and time.</p>
