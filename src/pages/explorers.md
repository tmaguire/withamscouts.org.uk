<p>We welcome any person over the age of 14*, with or without a background in Scouting. Join us to gain skills for life. Camping, bowling, hammock sleeping, self defense, community volunteering, world travel, climbing, t-shirt printing,
game bird preparation, pizza eating, fire lighting, axe throwing, shelter building, first aid, video gaming, cycling, town planning, clay pigeon shooting, presentation skills, nan bread making, yoga, computer building, map reading,
animation creation, kayaking, and pantomime production are some of the experiences Explorers have had since we opened in 2011.</p>
<p>Our Explorers have travelled to Holland, Poland, Estonia, Sweden, Australia, America, and Japan.</p>
<p>Explorers have gone onto become bar tenders, an IT analyst, a Banker, a Social media executive, Shop assistant, an Electrician, a Doctor, RN Seaman, pizza creator, Accounts assistant, a ground worker, bachelor of science, artist,
Teacher, Office Manager, Composer, and Mechanic. A diverse group of people all sharing Explorer Scouts at the heart it.</p>
<p>The unit is run by volunteer leaders with professional backgrounds in construction, IT and train driving. The unit isn't a stereotype of Scouting, please come along for a couple of our Explorer taster sessions to see for yourself.</p>
<p>Meeting on Monday evenings during term time, the unit enjoys the luxury of using both local Scout halls and Prances Activity Centre in Wickham Bishops for the weekly meeting nights with weekend and summer camp activities held locally
and further afield.</p>
<p>Currently the cost of being an Explorer Scout is less than Â£14 a month. With weekend and special activities where additional cost involved is regularly subsidised.</p>
<p>All we ask is that your willing to get stuck in and learn new skills, have new experiences and make new friends. Apart from being over 14* there are no other prerequisites for being an Explorer Scout.</p>
<p>Contact us by emailing <a href="mailto:explorers@withamscouts.org.uk">explorers@withamscouts.org.uk</a> to find out more</p>
