            <p>Scout volunteers come in all shapes and sizes, backgrounds, professions and faiths. So does their level of commitment.</p>
            <p>You don’t need to have children involved in Scouts to volunteer your time or skills.</p>
            <p>Some volunteers choose to give regular hours like the 20 or so section leaders that make up the Witham Scouts leadership team.</p>
            <p>Committee members giving regular but no fixed hours. Parent helpers who attend section meetings to assist the leaders in implementing the program.</p>
            <p>Others offer adhoc hours for things like fundraising, maintenance and helping at camps.</p>
            <p>Witham Scouts always need additional adult volunteer support in any form.</p>
            <p>Two more volunteer leaders will allow another beaver colony to open in the town, giving 20 young people the access to Scouting and parents access to affordable out of school activities.</p>
            <p>Examples of parent help; parent who is a carpenter showing and helping cubs to make bird boxes.</p>
            <p>Parent who’s an accountant auditing the group of section finances.</p>
            <p>Parent writing a grant application and collating the evidence required.</p>
            <p>Parents driving group equipment to a camp.</p>
            <p>Sweeping the hall floor after a section meeting.</p>
            <p>Group of parents/grandparents/older siblings/neighbours clearing the overgrown garden at one of the halls.</p>
            <p>Group is parents running a Tombola at a community event.</p>
            <p>Attending beavers to make drinks, or assisting an individual with their craft.</p>
            <p>Your help however small goes along way to ensuring the continued success of Witham Scouts. Please get in touch with the individual group to offer your assurance or speak to your child’s section leader.</p>
